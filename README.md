# to-doApp

Creating an application that allows users to;
        1.)add taks
        2.)edit tasks
        3.)remove tasks
        4.)sort tasks
        5.)add different categories in the list section
        6.)remove selected lists.

Application will rely heavily on css and javascript in order to function correctly.

I will be applying my knowledge of utilizing github and git, and commit changes as i go along creating this project.
